# Space simulation game

## What I learned
- Physics Simulation: Implementing gravitational forces and collision physics enhanced my understanding of vector math and Newtonian mechanics.
- Level Design: Each level was crafted to introduce a new concept or highlight a unique feature of the physics system.
- Pygame: Gained hands-on experience with the pygame library, including managing game loops, handling user inputs, rendering graphics, and integrating sound.

## Overview
- Birds is a physics-based game built using Python and Pygame, where players control a "rocket" to navigate through gravitational forces and interact with various celestial objects to complete levels.




## Features
- Physics Simulation: Simulates gravitational forces between objects with mass.
- Collision Mechanics: Realistic collision handling between objects. (like billards/pool)

## Gameplay
1. Objective: Maneuver the rocket to make the target planet collide with the winning planet.
2. Controls:
    - UP/DOWN: Adjust the launch angle or power.
    - SPACE: Launch the rocket.
    - ESC: Pause the game.
3. Tips:
    - Avoid unnecessary collisions.
    - Use gravitational forces strategically to reach the target.
